Difference between High Level and Low level languages
------------------------------------------------------------
* The main difference between high level language and low level language is that, Programmers can easily understand or interpret or compile the high level language in comparison of machine. On the other hand, Machine can easily understand the low level language in comparison of human beings.

Example:

* high level languages are C, C++, Java, Python, etc. Letâ€™s see the difference between high level and low level languages:

# It is programmer friendly language.
1. 	High level language is less memory efficient.
2. It is easy to understand.
3. Debugging is easy.
4. It is simple to maintain.
5. It needs compiler or interpreter for translation.

# It is a machine friendly language.
1. Low level language is high memory efficient.
2. It is tough to understand.
3. Debugging is complex comparatively.
4. It is complex to maintain comparatively.
5. It needs assembler for translation.
