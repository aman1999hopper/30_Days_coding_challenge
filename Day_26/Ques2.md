Js is compiler or intermediate language.
-----------------------------------------------
JavaScript is interpreted language. Here we will try to clear the age-long confusion related to JavaScript. One of the biggest questions that arise while learning JavaScript is whether it is compiled or interpreted or uses a JIT(Just In Time) compiler. To understand this concept we should be clear about the definitions of interpreter, compiler, and JIT compiler.

* Interpreter: An Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to an object code or machine code.
* Compiler: A compiler takes an entire program and converts it into object code which is typically stored in a file. The object code is also referred as binary code and can be directly executed by the machine after linking. 
* JIT compiler: A JIT compiler first converts the whole code to byte code and then uses the compiler at runtime to convert the code into machine-readable code. JIT compiler helps in faster execution.
