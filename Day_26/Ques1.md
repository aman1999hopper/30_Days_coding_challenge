Compiler 
----------------------
* The compiler saves the Machine Language in form of Machine Code on disks.   
* Compiled codes run faster than Interpreter.
* Linking-Loading Model is the basic working model of the Compiler.
Example:
C, C++, C#, etc are programming languages that are compiler-based.

Interpreter  
------------------
* The Interpreter does not save the Machine Language.
* Interpreted codes run slower than Compiler. 
* The Interpretation Model is the basic working model of the Interpreter.
Example:
Python, Ruby, Perl, SNOBOL, MATLAB, etc are programming languages that are interpreter-based.
