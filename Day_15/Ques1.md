What is node.js ?

* Node.js is open-source: This means that the source code for Node.js is publicly available. And it's maintained by contributors from all over the world. The Node.js contribution guide shows you how to contribute.

* Node.js is cross-platform: Node.js is not dependent on any operating system software. It can work on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

* Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment: When you write JavaScript code in your text editor, that code cannot perform any task unless you execute (or run) it. And to run your code, you need a runtime environment.

* Browsers like Chrome and Firefox have runtime environments. That is why they can run JavaScript code. Before Node.js was created, JavaScript could only run in a browser. And it was used to build only front-end applications.
