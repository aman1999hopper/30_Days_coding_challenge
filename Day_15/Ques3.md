Architecture of node js ?

1. Event Loop: Imagine a to-do list where tasks are waiting to be completed. The event loop is like the manager who constantly checks the list and assigns tasks to the computer's resources.

2. Non-Blocking: Node.js doesn't wait for one task to finish before starting another. It's like cooking multiple dishes in a restaurant's kitchen simultaneously.

3. Single-Threaded: Node.js primarily uses one thread to execute tasks. Think of it as one chef preparing many dishes in a kitchen.

4. Asynchronous: It can handle tasks that take time, like baking a cake, without stopping everything else. While the cake bakes, the chef can prepare other dishes.

5. Modules: Node.js uses modules, which are like specialized chefs for specific tasks. For example, there's a chef for making coffee and another for cooking pasta.

6. Event-Driven: Events trigger actions. Imagine a bell ringing (an event) in a restaurant's kitchen. It signals the chef to attend to a specific task.

7. Callback Functions: These are like instructions given to the chef. For example, "When the cake is ready, ring the bell."
