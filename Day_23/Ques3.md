single-threaded language

* JavaScript is a single-threaded language because while running code on a single thread, it can be really easy to implement as we don't have to deal with the complicated scenarios that arise in the multi-threaded environment like a deadlock. Since JavaScript is a single-threaded language, it is synchronous in nature.
